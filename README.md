# Fund Me Smart Contract

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. I have created a basic funding contract using Solidity. Users are able to add funds, check funds, and withdraw funds from the contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
